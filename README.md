LiquidityPoolERC20
Overview
LiquidityPoolERC20 is a smart contract developed in Solidity for creating and managing a decentralized liquidity pool for ERC-20 tokens. This project aims to facilitate seamless token swaps and liquidity provision on the Ethereum blockchain, enabling users to earn passive income through transaction fees generated from token swaps.

Features
Token Swapping: Allows users to swap between different ERC-20 tokens directly through the contract.
Liquidity Provision: Users can add their tokens to the liquidity pool and receive liquidity tokens in return, representing their share of the pool.
Fee Accumulation: Transaction fees are distributed to liquidity providers based on their share in the pool, incentivizing liquidity provision.
Decentralized: Operates in a trustless and decentralized manner, ensuring security and transparency.
Requirements
Solidity ^0.8.0 (or higher)
Ethereum Wallet (e.g., MetaMask)
Node.js and npm (for development and testing)
Truffle Suite (optional, for deployment and testing)
